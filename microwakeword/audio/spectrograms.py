        clips (Clips): Object that retrieves audio clips.
        augmenter (Augmentation | None, optional): Object that augments audio clips. If None, no augmentations are applied. Defaults to None.
        step_ms (int, optional): The window step size in ms for the spectrogram features. Defaults to 20.
        split_spectrogram_duration_s (float | None, optional): Splits generated spectrograms to yield nonoverlapping spectrograms with this duration. If None, the entire spectrogram is yielded. Defaults to None.
        slide_frames (int | None, optional): Strides the generated spectrograms to yield `slide_frames` overlapping spectrogram by removing features at the end of the spectrogram. If None, the entire spectrogram is yielded. Defaults to None.
